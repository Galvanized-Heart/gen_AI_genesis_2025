## Impact on Indigenous Education

Indigenous communities face a myriad of challenges in the educational system, including:

- **Language Marginalization:**  
  Many indigenous languages have been sidelined in formal education, leading to a disconnect between learnersâ€™ cultural heritage and the curriculum.

- **Cultural Erosion:**  
  The absence of indigenous language education contributes to the gradual loss of cultural identity and traditional knowledge.

- **Resource Scarcity:**  
  There is a significant lack of quality educational materials in indigenous languages, which hinders academic progress and cultural continuity.

- **Systemic Barriers:**  
  Historical and systemic inequities have limited the opportunities for indigenous communities to access education that reflects their linguistic and cultural needs.

TAI addresses these issues by:
- Developing tools and resources that integrate indigenous languages into educational content.
- Collaborating with indigenous educators and communities to ensure cultural accuracy and relevance.
- Creating a platform that not only teaches but also preserves and promotes indigenous languages and traditions.
