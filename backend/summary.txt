Here is a summary of the provided content into easy-to-follow core concepts:

**Unit 2: Cell Biology**

**2.1 The Microscope**

*   **Types of Microscopes:** Understanding the different kinds of microscopes (light, electron) and their functions.
*   **Magnification and Resolution:** Knowing the difference between magnification (making things look bigger) and resolution (making things clearer).
*   **Microscope Techniques:** Learning how to use a light microscope properly, including staining techniques.
*   **Sample Preparation:** Comparing how samples are prepared for light and electron microscopes.

**2.2 The Cell**

*   **Cell Theory:** Understanding the basic principles of cell theory (cells are the basic units of life).
*   **Cell Structures:** Identifying and describing the functions of key cell structures (nucleus, cell membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, cell wall, chloroplast, vacuole).
*   **Cell Types (Animal vs. Plant):** Drawing, labeling, and comparing typical plant and animal cells.
*   **Cell Specialization:** How some cells in multi-cellular organisms differentiate, or "specialize", to carry out specific functions (red blood cells, nerve cells, etc.).

**2.3 The Cell and Its Environment**

*   **Cell Membrane Permeability:** The cell membrane is *partially permeable* (allows some things through but not others).
*   **Diffusion:**  Particles move from areas of high concentration to low concentration.
*   **Osmosis:**  Water moves across a partially permeable membrane from areas of high water concentration to low water concentration (special kind of diffusion).
*   **Active Transport:**  Moving substances *against* a concentration gradient; *requires energy*.
*   **Importance of Transport:** Understanding why diffusion, osmosis, and active transport are essential for living organisms.
*   **Turgor Pressure and Plasmolysis:** *Turgor pressure* is when a plant cell swells because of osmosis, giving it rigidity. *Plasmolysis* is when a plant cell shrinks because of osmosis.
*   **Isotonic, Hypertonic, and Hypotonic Solutions:**
    *   Isotonic solutions have equal solute concentrations.
    *   Hypertonic solutions have a greater solute concentration.
    *   Hypotonic solutions have a lesser solute concentration.
