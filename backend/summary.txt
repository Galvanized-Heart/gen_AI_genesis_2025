Here's a summary of the key concepts from page 2 of the document:

*   **Page 2:** The building blocks of life are cells and scientists use microscopes to study them, since most cells are too small to see with the naked eye.
*   **Page 2:** There are two main types of microscopes: light microscopes and electron microscopes.
*   **Page 2:** Light microscopes use a beam of light to form an image, while electron microscopes use a beam of electrons.
*   **Page 2:** Microscopes are useful because they provide magnification, which means increasing the size of an object.
*   **Page 2:** Electron microscopes provide much higher magnification than light microscopes.
*   **Page 2:** Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two separate points; resolving power determines how much detail a microscope can show.
*   **Page 2:** Light microscopes have a limited resolving power compared to electron microscopes due to the wavelength of light.
*   **Page 2:** The limit of resolution for an optical light microscope is approximately 200 nanometres.
